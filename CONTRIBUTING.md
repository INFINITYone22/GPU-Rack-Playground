## Getting Started

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [GPU Rack Playground repository page](https://github.com/INFINITYone22/GPU-Rack-Playground). This creates your own copy of the project.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/GPU-Rack-Playground.git
    cd GPU-Rack-Playground
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. Please use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `fix-modal-bug`, `feature-new-scheduler`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your bug fix or feature.
    *   Please try to follow the existing coding style.
    *   Add comments for any new complex logic.
5.  **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes work as expected and don't introduce new issues. Run the simulator and test the functionality you've modified or added.
6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Description of your changes"
    ```
7.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
8.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    *   Click the "New pull request" or "Compare & pull request" button.
    *   Ensure the base repository is `INFINITYone22/GPU-Rack-Playground` and the base branch is `main`.
    *   Ensure the head repository is your fork and the compare branch is `your-branch-name`.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you've made and why. If it addresses an existing issue, please link to it (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    *   Submit the pull request.
